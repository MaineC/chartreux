# FLOSS resource collection

Over time, people have come up to me asking how to best publish code as an Open Source project. I end up sharing the same resources over and over - so I'm collecting them here.


Three stages
============

Most people come to free and open source software in three stages: Typically, first people use projects. In a later development people try to publish their own code - not thinking much about the burden of maitainership. At some stage, most people realize the value that exists when contributing changes back to projects, become involved more, likely start taking on leadership roles in existing projects - likely leading efforts to publish code and growing a community around it later on.

* Using Open Source
   * See https://tech.europace.de/oss-downstream/ for criteria for selecting Open Source projects to use (German language)

* Contributing to Open Source
   * See https://github.com/MaineC/ribbit for arguments to help you make a decision to contribute to existing Open Source projects
   
* Publishing Open Source projects

Collaboration groups:

* [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), open source metrics
* [InnerSource Commons](http://innersourcecommons.org), while focussed on using open source collaboration inside of organisations it provides clear, concise patterns on those exact collaboration patterns that help understand where the value of Open Source is coming from and how to benefit from it.
